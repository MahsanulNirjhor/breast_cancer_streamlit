# 🧠 Breast Cancer Predictor ML App

A beginner-friendly machine learning web app that predicts whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using logistic regression.  
Built with **Streamlit**, powered by **scikit-learn**, and deployed with a full **CI/CD DevOps pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **Streamlit Cloud**.

> 🎓 Developed as part of my machine learning journey to learn real-world machine learning application, test-driven development, and DevOps best practices.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- ✅ Built using **Logistic Regression** with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
- 🎨 Interactive UI using **Streamlit** (no frontend code needed)
- 🧪 **Test-Driven Development** using `pytest`
- ☁️ Fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions + auto-merge)
- 📁 Supports both **manual input** (via sliders) and **CSV batch prediction**
- 🧠 Includes auto-reset, result download, and prediction visualization (optional)

## 🚀 Live Demo

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs feature values manually **or uploads a CSV file**
2. The logistic regression model predicts whether the tumor is **benign** or **malignant**
3. The app displays the result, and allows users to download batch predictions as CSV

---

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

We follow TDD principles:
- All ML logic is **unit tested** using `pytest`
- CI pipeline automatically runs tests on every push
- The app only deploys if **all tests pass successfully**

✅ Tests give users and developers confidence in model performance and app stability.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD DevOps Pipeline

This app features a **full CI/CD workflow** using GitHub Actions:

| Stage       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **CI (Tests)** | On every push to `dev`, unit tests run via GitHub Actions |
| **CD (Deploy)** | Streamlit Cloud deploys the latest version from `main` |

🔐 Includes optional branch protection rules and secrets for secure auto-merge.
